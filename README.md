Authored by Devon Wieczorek, July 2016

LANGUAGES:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery
This extension comes with jQuery 3.0.0 included.

PURPOSE:
Love him or hate him, now that he is President Donald Trump is all over the internet more than ever. 
If you need a little vacation from him or his family (and can't afford a trip to Mar-a-lago) then the Duckify extension for Chrome can help.
This extension replaces instances of his name and images of him with Disney's classic Donald Duck. Now that's a Donald everybody can get on board with.

USAGE:
To install the extension, go to the Chrome Store and add it to your browser:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/Duckify

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- Images living inside of iFrames will not be replaced.

- Images are replaced by searching for specific strings in the source URL. If the source doesn't explicitly have reference to DJT in it,
  chances are it will not be replaced.

- (Not necessarily a limitation but) This extension may slow down the load time of image-heavy pages.
